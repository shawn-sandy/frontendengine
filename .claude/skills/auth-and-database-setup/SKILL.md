# Auth and Database Setup

Take a running copy of astro-basics from "login and database are off" to "on and
verified". If the site does not run yet, do the `project-setup` skill first.

## Ground rules

- **Secrets never pass through the chat.** The person pastes keys into `.env`
  themselves. You check the result with the status script, which prints no values.
  If they paste a secret key into the chat anyway, tell them to regenerate it in that
  service's dashboard. The old one is now in the chat history.
- **Never read `.env`.** No `cat`, no Read tool, no `grep` that prints lines. Use the
  status script.
- `npm run db:wizard` is an alternative for the database keys, but it is interactive,
  so only the person can run it, in their own terminal. It does not set
  `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`, so those still need editing by hand.
- `.env` is only read at startup. Restart `npm run dev` after every edit.

## Step 0 - Where things stand

If there is no `.env`, create one from the template. Never overwrite an existing one:

```bash
cp -n .env.example .env
```

Then run the status script:

```bash
node --env-file=.env .claude/skills/auth-and-database-setup/scripts/status.mjs
```

Each feature shows `ON` or `OFF`, using the app's own rules. Each setting shows `ok`,
`placeholder`, `missing`, `unusable` (the app will ignore it), or `set, but ...` (the
app accepts it, but it is probably pasted in the wrong place or only half replaced).
Tell them in plain words what is on, then ask what they want: login, a database, or
both.

## Part A - Login (Clerk)

1. They sign up at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com), create an application (email
   sign-in is fine to start), and open **API Keys** in the Clerk dashboard.
2. In `.env` they replace `YOUR_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with the key that starts
   `pk_`, and `YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY` with the one that starts `sk_`. The trailing
   `# comment` on each line can stay.
3. Run the status script. `Login (Clerk): ON` with both keys `ok` is the goal.
   `set, but expected pk_...` usually means the two keys were swapped. Login still
   shows ON because the app accepts the values, but sign-in will fail.
4. Restart `npm run dev`. The terminal should no longer print "Using dummy Clerk
   keys". Open `http://localhost:4321/dashboard`. It should send them to a Clerk
   sign-in page, and after they sign up it should bring them back to the dashboard.

`/dashboard`, `/forum`, and `/organization` require sign-in. Everything else stays
public.

**Webhook (optional, Supabase only).** The webhook copies Clerk users into the
Supabase `users` table. Clerk cannot reach `localhost`, so this only works on a
deployed site. In the Clerk dashboard, go to **Webhooks** and add the endpoint
`https://<their-site>/api/webhooks/clerk`. Subscribe it to the `user.*` and
`organizationMembership.*` events. Then they paste its Signing Secret (`whsec_...`)
into `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Part B - Database (Supabase)

Supabase stores signed-in users with their roles, organizations, and preferences.
It is the only database the app uses. The contact form (`/message-us`) does not use
it: submissions are only emailed, which needs the email settings (out of scope here).

1. They create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and open
   **Project Settings > API**.
2. In `.env` they replace the placeholders:
   - `SUPABASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: the Project URL (`https://...`), not the
     REST endpoint that ends in `/rest/v1`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: the anon (or publishable)
     key
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: the service_role (or secret) key. This key is
     needed for Clerk user sync.
3. Create the schema. In the Supabase dashboard, open **SQL Editor** and run these
   three files, in order and one at a time:
   - `scripts/migrations/001_core_schema.sql`
   - `scripts/migrations/002_security_policies.sql`
   - `scripts/migrations/007_data_api_grants.sql`

   The third file lets the site read and write the new tables. Newer Supabase
   projects give it no access by default, and without this file every request fails
   with `permission denied` (42501).

   On a Mac, `pbcopy < scripts/migrations/001_core_schema.sql` puts a file on the
   clipboard. Skip the other files in that folder. `scripts/migrations/README.md`
   explains why.

4. Run the status script. The goal is `Database: Supabase: ON` and
   `Supabase users table: found`. With login on too, it should also say
   `Clerk user sync: ready`. Otherwise signed-in users are never stored.

The policies in `002` check the Clerk user's ID, so queries made from the browser
also need Clerk added as a Third-Party Auth provider in Supabase. Server-side code
uses the service role key and does not need it. The steps are in
`src/content/docs/guide/integrations/clerk-supabase.mdx`.

## When something goes wrong

| What they see                                     | What it means                                                 | What to do                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status script says `ok` but the site is unchanged | The dev server is still using the old `.env`                  | `Ctrl+C`, `npm run dev`                                                                |
| `node: .env: not found`                           | There is no `.env` yet                                        | Step 0                                                                                 |
| `Supabase users table: MISSING (404)`             | The schema SQL has not been run, or the API cannot see it yet | Part B, step 3. If it already ran, check that the Data API exposes the `public` schema |
| `Supabase users table: exists, but ... (42501)`   | The table is there, but the service role has no grants on it  | Run `scripts/migrations/007_data_api_grants.sql` (Part B, step 3)                      |
| `Supabase users table: key rejected`              | The key it names was copied wrong or is from another project  | Recopy the key it names                                                                |
| `could not reach SUPABASE_URL (ENOTFOUND)`        | Typo in the URL, or the project is paused                     | Check the Project URL; resume the project in the Supabase dashboard                    |
| `SUPABASE_URL` says `without /rest/v1`            | They pasted the REST endpoint; the app adds `/rest/v1` itself | Delete `/rest/v1` from the end of `SUPABASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`             |
| `Supabase users table: timed out`                 | The URL points at something that never answers                | Check the Project URL is the one from **Project Settings > API**                       |
| `Clerk user sync: not ready`                      | Login is off, the service key is unset, or users table failed | Part A, Part B step 2, or the users table row above                                    |

## Done

Run the status script one last time and report what is on, in plain words. Out of
scope for this skill: custom roles (`npm run setup:roles`, which is interactive, so
they run it in their own terminal), email, and Axiom logging.
