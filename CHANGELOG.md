## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Dashboard app shell** (`src/layouts/Dashboard.astro`, `src/components/dashboard/`): `/dashboard`,
  `/dashboard/users` and `/profile` now share a dashboard layout with its own sidebar in place of
  the site navigation and footer
  - `DashboardSidebar` is a sticky column at 64rem and wider; below that it collapses to a top bar
    whose menu button opens the same links in a native `popover`, so there is one copy of the links.
    The account button sits in the bar on narrow screens rather than in the popover, because Clerk
    renders its account menu outside the sidebar and a click there light-dismissed the popover. A
    small script closes a menu left open when the viewport widens past the breakpoint. The whole
    sidebar is one `nav` landmark, and the current page is marked with `aria-current`
  - `DashboardPage` gives every dashboard page the same header (eyebrow, title, optional actions)
    and content width
  - New building blocks: `AccountPanel`, `DashboardCallout`, `DashboardSection`, `StatusPill`,
    `DashboardIcon` and a named line-icon set (`icons.ts`)
  - `fetchCurrentUserWithRole` (`src/utils/dashboard-user.ts`) looks up the signed-in user at most
    once per request, keyed on `Astro.locals`; the layout, the page and `UserInfo` share it, so a
    dashboard page makes one Clerk call. `getDashboardUser` shapes that result for display, with the
    last sign-in in UTC and labelled as such
  - `Base.astro` gains a `hideSiteChrome` prop to omit the site navigation and footer

- **Theme toggle** (`src/components/astro/ThemeToggle.astro`, `src/layouts/Base.astro`): a
  light/dark button in the site navigation bar
  - Stamps `:root[data-theme]`, which the token layer already honours over `prefers-color-scheme`;
    until a visitor chooses, nothing is stamped and the OS preference stays in charge
  - Stores the choice under Starlight's `starlight-theme` key, so the site and the docs routes
    share one preference
  - An inline `<head>` script in `Base.astro` restores the choice before first paint, so a stored
    theme never flashes the OS theme first
  - Native `<button>` with `aria-pressed`; the sun/moon icon is keyed off the root theme in CSS so
    it is correct before any script runs
  - `e2e/theme-toggle.spec.ts` covers both switch directions, persistence before first paint, OS
    fallback and the Starlight hand-off

- **Design System Record** (`DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `.impeccable/design.json`): the incumbent
  visual system and durable product context captured as machine-readable records
  - `DESIGN.md` follows the DESIGN.md format spec — YAML frontmatter carrying the eleven colour
    tokens, six type roles, radius and spacing scales, and nine component definitions, followed by
    the eight canonical prose sections
  - Ten named rules extracted from the implementation, including The Hydration Rule (colour marks
    interactivity), The One Weight Rule (one self-hosted display weight, one font request), and
    The 320 Rule (nothing widens the document at a 320px viewport)
  - Creative North Star recorded as "The Instrument Reading": neutral ground, precise scale,
    exactly one lit indicator
  - `.impeccable/design.json` sidecar carries what the frontmatter schema cannot — computed OKLCH
    canonicals and eight-step tonal ramps per colour, shadow and motion vocabularies, breakpoints,
    and seven drop-in component HTML/CSS snippets
  - `PRODUCT.md` records the evaluating-developer audience, the three confirmed differentiators,
    clone-or-template distribution, and an explicit list of evidence the project does **not** have,
    so future work cannot fabricate it
  - The README's Styling System section links `DESIGN.md` and a published Astro Kit design system
    artifact that renders its tokens, type roles and components in light and dark themes
- **Impeccable live mode** (`.impeccable/live/config.json`): durable configuration for browser-based
  design iteration. Running live mode injects a picker `<script>` into `src/layouts/Base.astro` and
  writes session state under `.impeccable/live/`; both are local development artifacts, removed by
  `live-server.mjs stop` and excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- **Homepage Design Direction** (`src/components/astro/HomeHero.astro`, `src/styles/_design-tokens.scss`):
  the homepage now renders live component specimens instead of describing them
  - Seven direction tokens — `--ink`, `--ink-soft`, `--paper`, `--paper-sunk`, `--island`,
    `--island-bg`, `--rule` — each flipping in both `prefers-color-scheme: dark` and the
    `:root[data-theme]` override path, so an explicit toggle always beats the OS preference
  - "Colour marks hydration": `--island` paints only interactive elements. An E2E test fails the
    build if any non-interactive element computes to the accent
  - Three type roles where there was previously one: display (self-hosted Inter 600,
    24KB latin subset, preloaded), body (system sans), mono (code and labels)
  - `HomeHero.astro`: full-bleed band pairing a rendered `Card` with the import line that produces
    it. Content stays on the 80rem measure via `padding-inline: max(gutter, (100% - maxw) / 2)`
  - `FeatureCards.astro` gains `sectionTitle` and `promoted` props for two-tier output — promoted
    specimens carry a code slot, the remainder render as compact rows. Both default to the
    existing six-card layout, so current call sites are unaffected
  - `Card.astro` exports its `Props` type and accepts a named `code` slot
  - Docs: `project-docs/03-features/design-direction.md` and a Starlight guide at
    `/guide/design-direction`
- **Popover Navigation** (`src/components/astro/Navigation.astro`): site navigation moved into a
  native HTML popover panel opened by a hamburger button, at every viewport width
  - Zero JavaScript: open, close, Esc-to-close and outside-click dismissal all come from the
    `popover="auto"` and `popovertarget` attributes
  - `popover="auto"` is written explicitly. The attribute's invalid-value default is `manual`,
    which silently has no light dismiss and no Esc close
  - Exported `Props` type: `brandTitle`, `brandHref`, `menuId`, `showBrand`
  - Site-title brand link on the left; the Clerk auth control stays in the bar
  - `userId`-gated dashboard and profile links render into the panel through the default slot,
    so signed-in users get the same decluttered bar
  - 44x44px hit area (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8), `aria-label="Primary"` landmark, reduced-motion-safe fade
  - `@supports not selector(:popover-open)` fallback renders the links as a static inline row and
    hides the hamburger in engines without the Popover API
  - New `sass:build` script for one-shot SCSS compilation (`npm run sass` is a watcher that never
    terminates, so it cannot be used as a verification command)
  - Coverage: `tests/components/Navigation.astro.test.ts` (8 cases) and
    `e2e/navigation-popover.spec.ts` (10 cases, passing on Chromium)
  - The popover is presentational and never an access-control mechanism; authenticated-only
    markup stays behind the server-side `userId` check
  - Full documentation: [Navigation Popover guide](/guide/components/navigation-popover)
- **Breaking (library consumers)**: `Navigation.astro`'s default slot now renders inside the
  popover panel rather than in the bar
- **Skip to main content link** (`src/layouts/Base.astro`): first focusable element on every page,
  letting keyboard users bypass the nav bar. Matters more now that the hamburger button, not the
  brand link, owns first focus
  - Styling comes from `@fpkit/acss`'s existing `body > a[href^="#"]` rule rather than a
    reimplementation, so it keeps that rule's slide-in transition and `--color-skip-link-bg` token
  - Target is the `<main id="main" tabindex="-1">` landmark in
    `src/components/astro/MainSection.astro`; `tabindex="-1"` is what moves focus rather than only
    the scroll position
  - `src/pages/offline.astro` and `src/pages/supabase-test.astro` bypass `MainSection`, so both
    gained their own `<main>` landmark (neither had one before)
  - Coverage: `e2e/skip-link.spec.ts`
- **User Sync Utility** (`src/utils/user-sync.ts`): Consolidated utility for fetching user data from Clerk and syncing with Supabase
  - `fetchUserWithRole()` function reduces component code by 80% (1 line vs 40+ lines)
  - Automatic user creation when users don't exist in database (handles PGRST116 errors)
  - Race condition safety with upsert operations (prevents duplicate user creation)
  - Graceful error handling with structured error fields (`error` for critical, `roleError` for warnings)
  - Non-throwing design allows components to display appropriate error messages
  - Default role assignment (`'member'`) for new users
  - Re-exported through `#utils/user-sync` and `#utils` for convenient importing
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples
  - Full documentation: [User Sync Utility Guide](/guide/utilities/user-sync)
- **Component Updates**: Refactored `UserInfo.astro` to use new User Sync Utility
  - Eliminated duplicate user fetching and role sync code
  - Consistent error handling across user-facing components
  - Improved maintainability with centralized sync logic
- **Comment System**: Full-featured comment system for blog posts and documentation pages
  - Polymorphic database design supporting multiple content types (`post`, `doc`)
  - Threaded comments with 3-level nesting support
  - Real-time comment creation, editing, and deletion
  - User authentication via Clerk integration
  - Rate limiting and spam protection (5 comments per minute per user)
  - Content sanitization with DOMPurify for XSS prevention
  - CSRF token validation for secure form submissions
  - Soft delete functionality (comments marked as 'archived')
  - Responsive design with accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Server-side rendering with client-side interactivity
- Documentation improvements and updates
- **Auth and database setup skill** (`.claude/skills/auth-and-database-setup/`): a Claude skill
  that turns on Clerk login and a Turso or Supabase database
  - The person pastes every key into `.env` themselves, so no secret passes through the chat
  - `scripts/status.mjs` reports each feature as ON or OFF using the same rules as
    `src/utils/env-config.ts`, and never prints a key, URL or hostname
  - When Supabase is configured, it also checks that the `users` table from
    `scripts/migrations/001_core_schema.sql` exists (10-second timeout), and whether Clerk
    user sync is ready (login on plus `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`)
  - The `project-setup` skill now hands login and database setup off to it

### Changed

- **E2E tests follow one base URL** (`playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/`): specs navigate with relative
  paths instead of a hard-coded `http://localhost:4321`, and `use.baseURL` reads
  `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:4321`). The dev server Playwright starts uses the
  port from the same URL. Previously a server from another checkout holding 4321 was tested
  silently
- **Homepage hero speaks to the agentic starter** (`src/components/astro/HomeHero.astro`): the
  headline is now "Build agentic web apps on Astro Kit.", the deck names what comes wired in (login,
  database, dashboard) and that the repo is set up for Claude Code, and the eyebrow drops the "zero
  client JS" claim, which is Astro's baseline and not something the kit adds
- **Homepage sections have headings** (`src/pages/index.astro`): "What's in the kit" and "Latest
  posts" as `h2`s, so the feature cards and the post list no longer follow the hero `h1` without a
  section heading of their own
- **PRODUCT.md** names the primary user as a non-developer who hands the repo to Claude Code, drops
  the Turso and threaded-comment claims, and records the open security constraints (auth fails open
  without Clerk keys; `POST /api/test/sync-user` has no auth check)

- **Breaking: the contact form is email-only** (`src/pages/api/message-us.ts`): submissions to
  `POST /api/message-us` (the `/message-us` page) are no longer stored; each one is delivered only
  as the `contact-notification` email
  - Requires `EMAIL_PROVIDER`, `EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` and
    `EMAIL_TO_ADDRESS`; without them the endpoint answers 503 instead of accepting the message
  - A failed send answers 502 rather than reporting success, since nothing else records it
  - The response no longer carries an `id`, the email no longer shows a message ID, and the sender's
    IP address and user agent are no longer recorded (`src/utils/ip-validation.ts` removed)
  - `GET /api/message-us` reports whether email is configured instead of the database provider

- **Supabase is the only database**: `db:wizard` and `db:status` configure and report Supabase
  only, `src/utils/env-config.ts` drops `TURSO_*` and `DATABASE_PROVIDER`, and `npm run setup:roles`
  generates PostgreSQL migrations only and prints the `psql` command to apply them

- **Dashboard components restyled to the design direction** (`src/components/dashboard/`):
  `StatsCards` is a single hairline-divided strip, `PostPreview` a column list that stacks in narrow
  containers, `ActivityFeed` a timeline and `QuickActions` a row list. Existing props still work:
  `icon` accepts a dashboard icon name or, as before, any text such as an emoji, and posts gain an
  optional `href` for an edit link. "Create new post" moves from the quick actions to the page header

- **Accent repointed from violet to petrol** (`src/styles/_design-tokens.scss`): `--island` and
  `--island-bg` move off the violet/indigo family that generated palettes converge on
  - Light `#5b2cf5` → `#0b6070`, dark `#9b7dff` → `#6bb9c9`; the washes follow, `#f0ebff` →
    `#e6f2f6` and `#1e1830` → `#102a33`. Low chroma is the intent: the accent now sits beside ink
    as a second voice instead of shouting over it
  - Two token declarations cover the whole surface. Links (`--link-color`), focus rings, both hero
    CTAs and the feature-card accent already resolved through `--island`, so no component changed
    colour by hand. The `color-mix` hover states needed no rework either — they mix toward `--ink`,
    which is hue-agnostic
  - Contrast measured against the running page in both themes: links, ghost label and primary fill
    all 7.01:1 in light and 8.54:1 in dark; accent on its own wash 6.30:1 light, and the lowest
    pair overall is unchanged at ink-soft on paper-sunk (5.39:1 light, 6.77:1 dark)
  - `e2e/homepage-design-direction.spec.ts` needed no assertion change: it reads `--island` off the
    live document and resolves it through the browser's own colour parser rather than comparing
    against a literal
- **Hero call-to-action colour pass** (`src/components/astro/HomeHero.astro`): the two hero CTAs
  read as a primary and a secondary rather than as two equal buttons
  - The secondary's border drops from full-chroma `--island` to the neutral `--rule`. Both buttons
    previously painted the accent at the same strength, so the border measured the same 7.01:1
    against paper as the primary's fill and the pair carried identical visual weight. The accent
    stays on the secondary's label, so "colour marks hydration" is unaffected — the rule forbids
    accenting elements a visitor _cannot_ operate, and the E2E audit only polices that direction
  - Hover and pressed fills are mixed toward ink in OKLCH at 88% and 78%. `--ink` is near-black in
    light and near-white in dark, so a single pair of declarations darkens the accent on paper and
    lightens it on the dark surface with no second theme block. Label contrast rises rather than
    falls in both: light 7.01 → 8.07 → 9.04, dark
    8.54 → 9.24 → 9.88. The mix is `oklch` because the same operation in sRGB mutes the accent's
    chroma as it darkens
  - The primary previously had no colour change on hover at all; `text-decoration: underline` was
    its only feedback. The underline stays as the non-colour cue, so the state never relies on hue
  - The secondary promotes its border back to the accent on hover, earning at hover what the
    resting state trades away for hierarchy
  - `transition` covers `background-color` and `border-color` only at 150ms. Nothing moves, so
    there is no motion to gate behind `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Typographic hierarchy pass** (`src/styles/_base.scss`, `src/components/astro/Footer.astro`,
  `src/pages/index.astro`): three adjustments so heading, body and supporting text read at
  distinct levels
  - The display role now covers `h1` through `h6` rather than `h1`-`h3`. Every level resolves to
    weight 600, the single weight the self-hosted woff2 ships, so the wider range costs no
    additional font request. `text-transform: capitalize` deliberately stays on `h1`-`h3`: `h4`-`h6`
    are used for UI labels, and the contact form's `h6` error summary would otherwise render as
    "Please Correct The Following Errors"
  - Footer drops to `0.875rem` on `--ink-soft`, matching the compact feature rows. Social links
    need `--link-fs` retuned rather than a `font-size` override, because the vendor rule
    `a[href] { --link-fs: 1rem; font-size: var(--link-fs) }` declares the variable on the element
    itself, where inheritance cannot reach it
  - The homepage hero and the feature cards were flush; the composing section in `index.astro` now
    carries `margin-block-start: 4rem`. The spacing lives at the call site because `FeatureCards`
    is a package export and must not carry homepage-specific margin
- **Navigation styles scoped to `[data-site-nav]`**: every selector in
  `src/styles/components/_navigation.scss` and in `Navigation.astro`'s `is:inline` first-paint
  block previously matched bare `nav`, `nav:has(> [popover])` and `nav > button[popovertarget]`.
  `Navigation` is exported from `src/components/index.ts` and the package's `./astro` entry, so a
  consumer page with its own popover navigation inherited the site's 44x44 button, transparent
  border and fixed-position panel
  - The root `nav` now carries `data-site-nav` and all 22 selectors are prefixed with it
  - The marker adds `(0,1,0)` uniformly, so every precedence relationship is preserved: the
    inline block moves `(0,1,2)` -> `(0,2,2)` and the stylesheet rules `(0,2,2)` -> `(0,3,2)`
  - **Breaking (library consumers)**: hand-written popover nav markup that relied on these styles
    leaking out of the package must add `data-site-nav` to its root `nav`. Consumers rendering the
    exported `Navigation` component are unaffected — it carries the marker itself

- **Page background**: `body` now sets an explicit `background-color: #fff` in
  `src/styles/_base.scss`. Nothing previously painted the body, so pages fell back to the
  browser's default canvas, which renders dark under `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. The value is
  literal rather than tokenised, so the page stays white in both colour schemes
  - **Superseded by the Homepage Design Direction work above**: the literal is now
    `var(--paper)`, which is the point — the body is meant to follow the colour scheme rather
    than stay white in both. The original entry stands as the record of why the literal was
    there; it is no longer the current behaviour
- Minor updates and refinements

### Removed

- **Messages feature**: the `messages` table, the dashboard inbox (`/dashboard/messages`), the
  `/forum` page (it only listed messages), `/api/messages`, `MessageList.astro`, `MessagesList.tsx`,
  the `useSupabase` hook, `src/libs/supabase-server.ts`, and `npm run db:seed:messages`
  - `scripts/migrations/006_drop_messages_table.sql` drops the table from existing Supabase
    databases. It is irreversible; export the table first if you need its rows
- **Turso and the database abstraction layer**: `getDatabase()` (`src/libs/database.ts`,
  `src/libs/database-types.ts`), `src/libs/turso.ts`, `db/migrations/`, `db/schema.sql` and the
  `@libsql/client` dependency
- **Database tooling built on them**: `db:setup`, `db:manage`, `db:schema`, `db:reset`, `db:check`,
  `db:migrate*`, `db:switch*`, `db:backup`, `db:restore`, `test:db:connection` and
  `test:db:abstraction`, their scripts, and the matching `/db-*` Claude commands except
  `/db-setup` and `/db-status`
- **Supabase test page**: `/supabase-test` and `/api/supabase-test`

### Fixed

- **Supabase tables unreachable without automatic Data API grants; users could set their own
  role** (`scripts/migrations/007_data_api_grants.sql`): 001 and 002 relied on Supabase granting
  every API role full access to new tables. Projects without those grants (the default for new
  projects since 2026-05-30) answered `42501 permission denied` to every role, including the
  service role behind the Clerk webhook and user sync. Where the grants did exist, a signed-in user
  could update their own `users.role`, which `requireRole()` trusts. 007 revokes everything, then
  grants `service_role` full DML and `authenticated` only what `/api/user/profile` and
  `/api/user/profile-with-org` use, with column-level `UPDATE`. `anon` gets nothing. Rollback in
  `rollback_007_data_api_grants.sql`
  - The auth-and-database-setup status script reads an anon `42501` as the table existing, and
    once the anon key checks out it probes again as `service_role` when
    `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set. Clerk user sync stays "not ready" until that probe passes
  - The setup guides list 007 in their fresh-install steps
- **Dashboard menu covered the page in browsers without popovers** (`src/components/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.astro`):
  below 64rem the sidebar's link panel was always `position: fixed`, and where the `popover` attribute
  is unsupported (Chrome and Edge before 114, Safari before 17, Firefox before 125) nothing hid it,
  so it sat over the page permanently while the menu button did nothing. The fixed dropdown now
  applies only under `@supports selector(:popover-open)`. Browsers that support `@supports selector()`
  but not popovers list the links in flow under the bar, hide the button and stop the bar sticking;
  older browsers without `@supports selector()` also get the links in flow instead of an overlay

- **Homepage polish** (`src/pages/index.astro`, `src/components/astro/HomeHero.astro`,
  `FeatureCards.astro`, `Card.astro`, `Footer.astro`)
  - The promoted feature specimens printed `<Card cardTitle="…" />`, which renders an empty card;
    they now print the body the card beside them actually renders
  - Hero, features and post list share one left edge (they sat at 16, 20 and 32px on mobile, and the
    post list 32px in on desktop)
  - Post titles on the homepage take the card-title size instead of the vendor `--h3` scale, which
    reached 48px at desktop and outranked everything below the hero
  - The headline no longer hyphenates mid-word at common phone widths; `hyphens: auto` now applies
    only below 21rem, and `text-wrap: balance` keeps a short headline from stranding its last word
  - The hero overrode the vendor `header { min-width: 20rem }`, which scrolled the page 15px
    sideways at 320px in browsers with a classic scrollbar (SC 1.4.10)
  - The scrolling code samples in the hero and the promoted cards take `tabindex="0"`, so a keyboard
    can scroll them (axe `scrollable-region-focusable`)
  - The footer read "ontwitter"; the compact feature rows lost a stray 8px list indent
- **`.impeccable/hook.cache.json` is ignored** (`.gitignore`): the design hook's per-session cache
  holds absolute local paths and was committed by accident

- **Dark mode left light surfaces on several pages** (`src/styles/_design-tokens.scss`,
  `src/styles/components/_form.scss`, `_alert.scss`, `_card.scss`, and the dashboard, profile,
  offline and message-us pages): @fpkit/acss's own `[data-theme=dark]` block points
  its semantic tokens at the dark end of the neutral scale, which the site's dark palette has already
  inverted, so the two flips cancelled under the theme toggle. The skip link measured `#f4f4f5` and
  white text on the vendor's dark-mode button blue measured 3.52:1. The toggle path now restates the
  vendor's light mapping for those tokens, and hard-coded light colours on the listed pages and
  stylesheets use the direction tokens instead. Form fields kept a `whitesmoke` fill under light
  text in dark mode, which made typed input unreadable

- **`db:migrate` scripts never loaded `.env`** (`package.json`): `db:migrate`,
  `db:migrate:status`, `db:migrate:create` and `db:migrate:rollback` ran
  `node scripts/migrate.js`, and the `--env-file=.env` in that file's shebang does not apply under
  `node <file>`. With Turso configured in `.env` they still reported "Missing required environment
  variables". They now pass `--env-file=.env` like the other `db:*` scripts, so like those
  scripts they need a `.env` file to exist. `scripts/migrate.js` treats `YOUR_...` placeholders as
  missing, so a fresh copy of `.env.example` gets the missing-variables message instead of a libsql stack trace
- **`db:status` reported `.env.example` placeholders as set** (`scripts/database-status.js`): any
  truthy value printed "✓ Set", so an unedited `YOUR_...` placeholder counted as a configured
  database. Values starting with `YOUR_` now count as not set, as they do in
  `src/utils/env-config.ts`. `tests/scripts/db-scripts.test.ts` covers both fixes
- **Horizontal rules out-shouted the content they separated**: `@fpkit/acss` colours `hr` through
  `--color-border-subtle`, a legacy neutral step that the inverted dark palette turned near-white
  (#f4f4f5 on the dark blog list). `hr` now uses the `--rule` hairline token in both themes;
  `e2e/dividers.spec.ts` asserts it on `/` and `/posts/1`
- **`resetTursoClient()` threw `ReferenceError: cachedEnv is not defined`**: the variable was
  removed with the environment-config abstraction but its reset line was left behind, crashing
  every `tests/turso-crash.test.ts` hook
- **`useSupabase` lint warnings**: `catch (err: any)` replaced with `unknown` and a narrow
  `ClerkApiError` type for the JWT-template check
- **Design tokens had no consumers, so dark mode could not change a pixel**:
  `src/styles/_design-tokens.scss` declared a full alias layer that nothing read.
  `--card-background` and `--header-background` each had zero `var()` consumers, so every card and
  the header band fell through to the `@fpkit/acss` defaults — including a hardcoded `whitesmoke`
  on the header. The dark-mode block compounded this by redefining `:root` variables and nothing
  else, so no element repainted. Both aliases now have painted consumers, and the dark scope
  reaches the elements themselves. `tests/integration/design-tokens.test.ts` parses the compiled
  stylesheet and fails if either alias loses its last painting consumer
- **ESLint could not lint the E2E suite** (`eslint.config.js`): Playwright specs fell through to
  the unit-test override, which declares no browser globals, so every `page.evaluate` callback
  using `getComputedStyle`, `Element` or `Node` failed `no-undef` at the pre-commit hook. `e2e/**`
  now has its own override declaring those three globals
- **Popover fallback was silently inert in engines without `:has()`**: the
  `@supports not selector(:popover-open)` block in `src/styles/components/_navigation.scss` listed
  its bare and `:has()` selectors as one comma-separated list. A selector list is unforgiving, so a
  parser that cannot understand `:has()` discards the whole rule — including the bare selector that
  existed specifically to serve those engines. Each block is now written as two separate rules
- **Horizontal overflow at 320px viewports** (WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.10 Reflow): every page
  scrolled horizontally by 5px on a 320px-wide screen
  - Overrode `@fpkit/acss`'s `body { min-width: 20.3125rem }` (325px) floor with
    `min-width: 0` in `src/styles/_base.scss`. The floor was wider than the viewport
    it had to fit, so the overflow was present with the whole `<nav>` hidden and on
    every page including 404
  - `e2e/navigation-popover.spec.ts`'s 320px reflow test now asserts
    `scrollWidth <= clientWidth` outright, both panel-shut and panel-open. It
    previously had to measure against its own closed-panel baseline because the
    framework floor made an absolute check impossible
  - Added a page-level `no horizontal scrolling at 320px` case to
    `e2e/home-responsive.spec.ts`
- **Flaky axe-core scan in `e2e/navigation-popover.spec.ts`**: `:popover-open` flips at
  the start of the panel's 150ms opacity fade, so the WCAG scan could sample a
  still-transparent panel and report a colour-contrast violation that no user ever
  sees. The scan now waits for the fade to settle before running
- **`npm run db:wizard` wiped unrelated `.env` settings** (`scripts/setup-wizard.js`): the wizard
  rebuilt `.env` from a fixed list of Clerk, Turso, Supabase server, `ENABLE_COMMENTS` and
  `DATABASE_PROVIDER` keys, silently dropping `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`, `AXIOM_*`, `EMAIL_*`,
  `PWA_ENABLED`, `ASTRO_ADAPTER` and every comment. It also kept inline `# comments` as part of the
  values it read. The read/write logic now lives in `scripts/lib/env-file.js`: values are parsed
  with Node's `util.parseEnv` (the same parser as `node --env-file`), and only keys whose value
  changed are rewritten in place, keeping their inline comments. Every other line is left as is,
  and a leading BOM no longer hides the first key. `tests/scripts/setup-wizard-env.test.ts` runs
  the write path, and the real wizard with scripted answers, on `.env.example` plus an extra key,
  and fails if any unmanaged key, comment or blank line is lost or reordered

### Security

- **Protected routes no longer fail open without Clerk keys** (`src/middleware.ts`): with the Clerk
  keys missing or still the `YOUR_*` placeholders, `/dashboard` and `/organization` (and their
  sub-paths) used to be served to anyone. They now render a setup notice (`/auth-setup`) with HTTP 503. With real keys, unauthenticated visitors are still redirected to sign-in. The stale
  `/forum(.*)` entry is gone from the route matcher
- **Removed `POST /api/test/sync-user`**: it upserted any Clerk user into `users` with the
  service-role client and returned their profile, with no authentication. The authenticated
  `POST /api/user/sync` still syncs the signed-in user
- `e2e/auth-fail-closed.spec.ts` covers both, and CI runs it against the keyless production build
