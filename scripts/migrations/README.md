# Supabase Database Migrations

This directory contains PostgreSQL migrations for the Supabase database provider.

> **Note**: An older migration directory exists at `scripts/supabase-migrations/` (Aug 2025) that created a simpler users table. This was superseded by the comprehensive migrations in this directory (Oct 2025) which add roles, organizations, and preferences. For new installations, use the migrations in THIS directory.

---

## Quick Start

### Fresh Database Installation

For **new databases**, run only these three migrations in order:

```bash
# Set your Supabase connection string
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[password]@[project-ref].supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# Apply core schema
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/001_core_schema.sql

# Apply security policies
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/002_security_policies.sql

# Grant the API roles access to the tables
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/007_data_api_grants.sql
```

Run 007 on every project. Projects that have "Automatically expose new tables and functions" turned
off grant the API roles nothing, and every request gets `42501 permission denied`. On projects that
still grant automatically, 007 swaps those broad grants for the least-privilege set below.

**That's it!** Skip migrations 003 and 004 - they are deprecated/redundant.

---

### Existing Database Upgrade

If you have an **existing database** with older migrations applied, consult the upgrade guide:
`docs/database/supabase-migration-refactor-plan.md`

If your database has a `messages` table (the contact form used to store submissions there; it now
only sends a notification email), drop it with migration 006. This is **irreversible** - export the
table first if you need its contents:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\copy messages TO 'messages-backup.csv' CSV HEADER"
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/006_drop_messages_table.sql
```

## Active Migrations (Current State)

### ✅ Required Migrations

| File                          | Created    | Purpose                                                             | Status     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `001_core_schema.sql`         | 2025-10-12 | Core tables, roles, indexes, triggers                               | **ACTIVE** |
| `002_security_policies.sql`   | 2025-10-06 | Row Level Security (RLS) policies                                   | **ACTIVE** |
| `006_drop_messages_table.sql` | 2026-09-25 | Drop legacy `messages` table (existing databases only, no rollback) | **ACTIVE** |
| `007_data_api_grants.sql`     | 2026-09-25 | Table privileges for the API roles                                  | **ACTIVE** |

### ⚠️ Deprecated Migrations

| File                               | Created    | Purpose                     | Status                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `003_user_roles.sql`               | 2025-10-10 | Role ENUM creation          | **REDUNDANT** - Duplicates 001         |
| `004_clerk_email_verification.sql` | 2025-10-11 | Email uniqueness constraint | **DEPRECATED** - Consolidated into 001 |

**Why deprecated?** Migration 001 was refactored on 2025-10-12 to consolidate work from migrations 003 and 004. The numbered prefix (001) doesn't reflect chronological creation order.

## Migration Details

### 001_core_schema.sql

**Purpose**: Foundation migration establishing the entire user management system.

**Creates**:

- `user_role` ENUM type (`member`, `admin`, `super_admin`)
- `users` table (synced from Clerk authentication)
  - Stores clerk_id, email, username, full_name, avatar_url
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) with default role 'member'
  - JSONB app_metadata for application-specific data
- `organization_memberships` table (Clerk organizations sync)
- `user_preferences` table (app-specific settings: theme, notifications, language, timezone)
- 7 performance indexes including partial unique index on email
- `update_updated_at()` trigger function for automatic timestamp management
- Extensive documentation via SQL COMMENT statements

**Rollback**: `rollback_001_core_schema.sql`

---

### 002_security_policies.sql

**Purpose**: Implements Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables.

**Creates**:

- **Users table policies** (3 policies):
  - Users can view/update their own profile (Clerk JWT 'sub' claim)
  - Service role has full access (for webhooks)

- **Organization memberships policies** (3 policies):
  - Users view their own memberships
  - Org admins see all org members
  - Service role has full access

- **User preferences policies** (2 policies):
  - Users have full CRUD on their own preferences
  - Service role has full access

**Total**: 8 security policies with comprehensive documentation

**Rollback**: `rollback_002_security_policies.sql`

---

### 007_data_api_grants.sql

**Purpose**: Grants the Data API roles the table privileges the app uses. RLS decides which rows a
role sees. Grants decide whether it can reach the table at all. Without grants, every role gets
`42501`, including `service_role`: it bypasses RLS, but it still needs table privileges.

Supabase stopped granting automatically for new projects on 2026-05-30. Existing projects follow on
2026-10-30. See the
[changelog entry](https://supabase.com/changelog/45329-breaking-change-tables-not-exposed-to-data-and-graphql-api-automatically).

**Grants**:

| Role            | `users`                                                              | `organization_memberships`     | `user_preferences`                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `service_role`  | select, insert, update, delete                                       | select, insert, update, delete | select, insert, update, delete                                                              |
| `authenticated` | select; update `username`, `full_name`, `avatar_url`, `app_metadata` | select                         | select; update `theme`, `notifications_email`, `notifications_push`, `language`, `timezone` |
| `anon`          | none                                                                 | none                           | none                                                                                        |

`service_role` serves the Clerk webhook, user sync and the role guard. `authenticated` serves
`/api/user/profile` and `/api/user/profile-with-org`, which use the Clerk JWT. No code reads these
tables as `anon`.

007 revokes all privileges on the three tables before granting, so every project ends with the same
privileges on them. The automatic grants include table-wide `UPDATE` on `users`, which lets a signed-in user set
their own `role` through the Data API. `requireRole()` trusts that column. The column-level `UPDATE`
closes that path.

**Rollback**: `rollback_007_data_api_grants.sql` removes every privilege the API roles have on these
tables. It does not restore automatic grants. Restoring them means `GRANT ALL`, which reopens the
`role` hole.

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback All Migrations (Nuclear Option)

```bash
# Rollback in reverse order
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/rollback_007_data_api_grants.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/rollback_002_security_policies.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/rollback_001_core_schema.sql
```

**Warning**: This will drop all tables and data! Use with extreme caution.

### Rollback Single Migration

```bash
# Example: Rollback security policies only
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/rollback_002_security_policies.sql
```

---

## Archived Migrations

The `archived/` directory contains 6 original migrations from 2025-10-03 to 2025-10-04 that were **consolidated and replaced** on 2025-10-06.

**Original migrations had issues**:

- Fragmented role system setup across multiple files
- Type mismatches (TEXT column vs ENUM type)
- Complex dependency chains
- Deprecated 4-tier role system (member, coordinator, admin, super_admin)

**Replaced by**: Consolidated `001_core_schema.sql` + `002_security_policies.sql` with simplified 3-tier role system.

See `archived/README.md` for historical details.

## Migration Development Guidelines

### Creating New Migrations

1. **Naming Convention**: `00X_descriptive_name.sql`
   - Use sequential numbering (005, 006, etc.)
   - Use snake_case for descriptive names
   - Be specific: `add_user_avatars` not `update_users`

2. **Migration Structure**:

   ```sql
   -- Migration: 00X_descriptive_name.sql
   -- Created: YYYY-MM-DD
   -- Purpose: Brief description of what this migration does
   --
   -- Dependencies: List any migrations this depends on
   -- Rollback: rollback_00X_descriptive_name.sql

   BEGIN;

   -- Your migration code here

   -- Verification (optional but recommended)
   DO $$
   BEGIN
       -- Check that changes were applied correctly
   END $$;

   COMMIT;
   ```

3. **Always Create Rollback Scripts**:
   - Name: `rollback_00X_descriptive_name.sql`
   - Test rollback before committing
   - Document any data loss consequences

4. **Make Migrations Idempotent**:
   - Use `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses
   - Check for existing objects before creating
   - Allow migrations to be safely re-run

5. **Document Your Changes**:
   - Add SQL COMMENT statements for tables/columns
   - Explain business logic in migration comments
   - Update this README with new migration details

### Testing Migrations

```bash
# Test on local development database first
psql $DEV_DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/00X_new_migration.sql

# Verify changes
psql $DEV_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';"

# Test rollback
psql $DEV_DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/rollback_00X_new_migration.sql
```

## Migration Tracking

Currently, migrations must be **manually tracked** and applied in order.

**Planned Enhancement**: Migration tracking table to record applied migrations and prevent duplicate applications.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "relation already exists" error

This typically means you're re-running a migration that's already been applied. Options:

1. Skip the migration (if it's already applied)
2. Run the rollback script first, then re-apply
3. Check for idempotent design (migrations should handle this gracefully)

### "type already exists" error

The migration is trying to create an ENUM or type that already exists. Usually safe to ignore if the existing type matches expectations.

### RLS Policy blocking access

If you're getting permission denied errors:

1. `42501 permission denied for table ...` means the role has no table privileges. RLS is not the
   cause. Run `007_data_api_grants.sql`.
2. Check that RLS is enabled: `SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';`
3. Verify your JWT contains the correct claims (especially 'sub' for user ID)
4. Test with service role key (bypasses RLS) to isolate issue
5. Review policies: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';`

### Migration verification failures

If a migration's built-in verification fails:

1. Read the error message carefully (migrations include helpful verification)
2. Check that dependencies (other migrations) were applied first
3. Verify your database version supports required features
4. Check for data conflicts (duplicate emails, etc.)
