# Astro Basics Website

A production-ready Astro website showcasing modern web development practices with authentication, database
integration, and interactive features. This project demonstrates Astro's capabilities for building fast, secure,
content-focused websites with a comprehensive component library, multiple database backends, progressive web app
functionality, and enterprise-grade security features.

## Project Features

### Component Architecture

- **Astro Components** (`src/components/astro/`): Server-side rendered .astro components
- **React Components** (`src/components/react/`): Client-side interactive components
- **Component exports** through `src/components/index.ts` for internal organization

### Content Management

- Three content collections: `posts`, `docs`, and `content`
- Astro's content collections with shared schema
- MDX support with remark-toc and rehype-accessible-emojis
- **Comment System**: Full-featured commenting for blog posts and documentation
  - Threaded comments with 3-level nesting support
  - Real-time comment creation, editing, and soft deletion
  - Rate limiting (5 comments per minute per user) and spam protection
  - Content sanitization with DOMPurify for XSS prevention
  - CSRF token validation for secure form submissions

### Authentication & Security

- Clerk integration for user authentication with native Supabase integration (2025 production-ready)
- Protected routes via middleware (`/dashboard`, `/forum`, `/organization`)
- **Role-based access control** with hierarchical privilege escalation
  - Configurable user roles (member, admin, super_admin)
  - Automatic privilege inheritance (higher roles access lower-level content)
  - Component-level and page-level role guards
  - Flexible configuration with `useHierarchy` option for exact matching
- Environment-based configuration
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - CSRF protection for all form submissions
  - Rate limiting on API endpoints (5 requests/minute)
  - Input sanitization and XSS prevention
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance with external scripts
  - Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for database tables

### Database Integration

- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** with real-time capabilities and native Clerk integration
- Comment system with polymorphic database design
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

### Development Tools

- Comprehensive testing setup (Vitest + Playwright)
- SCSS compilation with Sass watcher
- Pre-commit hooks with Husky + lint-staged
- Complete linting setup (ESLint, StyleLint, Prettier, Markdown)
- GitHub Copilot integration with project-specific instructions
- **MCP Server Integration**: Model Context Protocol support for:
  - Supabase database operations
  - Chrome DevTools automation
  - Figma design system integration
  - Playwright browser testing
  - Clerk authentication management
- Automated release management system with security audits
- Supabase SQL migrations with rollback scripts (`scripts/migrations/`)

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

- Service worker with automatic caching and offline support
- App manifest with icons and metadata
- Custom PWA installation prompts
- Offline page and connection status indicators
- Auto-update functionality for service worker
- Standalone mode for full-screen app experience

### User Features

- **Dashboard**: Protected user dashboard with profile management
- **Organization Management**: Organization creation and management features
- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive user profile with Clerk integration
- **Contact Form**: `/message-us` submissions are delivered as a notification email (requires the
  `EMAIL_*` settings; see the [Email guide](src/content/docs/guide/integrations/email.mdx))

## Quick Start

### 5-Minute Setup

1. **Install and configure**:

   ```bash
   npm install                    # Install dependencies (~4 minutes)
   npm run prepare                # Setup pre-commit hooks
   cp .env.example .env           # Copy environment template
   ```

   The site runs on a fresh clone with no accounts and no keys — leave the `YOUR_*`
   placeholders in place. Clerk, Supabase, and Axiom each read an unreplaced
   placeholder as "not configured" and switch that feature off, so logging falls back to
   the console and auth-protected routes stay unavailable until you add real keys.

2. **Configure authentication** (optional, needed for sign-in and `/dashboard`):
   - Get Clerk keys from [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
   - Add to `.env`: `PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
   - Without these, auth-protected routes are unavailable and the rest of the site works

3. **Setup database** (optional, for advanced features):

   > **⚠️ Configure Roles First:** If you plan to customize user roles, configure them BEFORE running database migrations. Role configuration generates database migrations that define your role schema. See [Role Management](#role-management) below, or skip to use the default 3-tier system (member, admin, super_admin).

   ```bash
   npm run db:wizard              # Interactive Supabase setup wizard
   # Or manually: apply scripts/migrations/ with psql (see scripts/migrations/README.md)
   ```

4. **Start developing**:

   ```bash
   npm run start                  # Dev server + SCSS watcher (port 4321)
   ```

**For detailed setup instructions**, see [project-docs/01-getting-started/setup-guide.md](project-docs/01-getting-started/setup-guide.md) which includes:

- Complete authentication setup with Clerk
- Database configuration (Supabase)
- Role management system setup
- Security features configuration
- Troubleshooting common issues

### Development Commands

```bash

```

### Role Management

```bash
# Configure custom roles (edit config/roles.config.ts first)
npm run setup:roles           # Generate types and migrations
npm run setup:roles:dry-run   # Preview changes without writing files
npm run validate:roles        # Validate role configuration

# After setup, apply the generated migration with psql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/migrations/<NNN>_user_roles.sql
```

**Role System Features:**

- Configurable user roles with hierarchical privilege escalation
- TypeScript type generation for compile-time safety
- Automatic database migration generation
- Component-level and page-level role guards
- Zero runtime overhead

### Component Usage

```astro
---
// Using path aliases for internal component imports
import Header from '#components/astro/Header.astro'
import { ThemeToggle } from '#components/react/ThemeToggle'
import { RoleGuard } from '#components/react/RoleGuard'
import { SITE_TITLE } from '#utils/site-config'
---

<Header title={SITE_TITLE} />
<ThemeToggle client:load />

<!-- Role-based access control -->
<RoleGuard allowedRoles={['admin']} client:load>
  <AdminPanel />
</RoleGuard>
```

## Architecture

### Documentation System

- **Starlight Integration**: Modern documentation framework built on Astro
  - Interactive component documentation with live examples
  - API reference documentation with TypeScript integration
  - MCP Server setup guides and troubleshooting
  - Searchable documentation with Pagefind
  - Edit links and last updated timestamps
  - Custom theming and styling

### Path Aliases

Uses `#*` import alias mapping to `./src/*` for cleaner imports.

### Content Collections

Three main collections defined in `src/content/config.ts`:

- `posts` - Blog posts
- `docs` - Documentation content
- `content` - General content articles

### Styling System

- SCSS-based styling in `src/styles/`
- Component-specific styles in `src/styles/components/`
- Uses @fpkit/acss for additional CSS utilities
- Design system spec: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). The
  [Astro Kit design system](https://claude.ai/artifact/HKxyaqURmUX9WE4G8TiiW4) renders its tokens,
  type roles and components live in light and dark themes.

### Database Configuration

The project uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) as its only database. Server code reaches it through the
helpers in `#libs/supabase-native`:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

Migrations live in `scripts/migrations/` and are applied with `psql` — see
[scripts/migrations/README.md](scripts/migrations/README.md).

### Deployment

- **Active**: Netlify adapter (`@astrojs/netlify`)
- **Alternative**: Node.js adapter (`@astrojs/node`) - available but commented out
